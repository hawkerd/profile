        `Hi, I’m Dan—a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics, currently studying at the University of Minnesota. I’ve always been passionate about technology, and my strengths lie in programming and problem-solving. Alongside computer science, I’m pursuing a math minor to build critical thinking skills and reinforce the technical fundamentals that support engineering.`,

        `In my role as a software engineer at Graco, I lead core development efforts for ProMix V, our next-generation proportioning system. I’m responsible for overseeing code quality, conducting thorough reviews, and implementing major parts of the system myself. I manage the development cycle in collaboration with our team in Delhi, guiding us through agile processes, daily standups, sprints, retrospectives, and release cycles. Using Jira for project management and Git with BitBucket for version control, I ensure our workflows are efficient and our deliverables meet high standards. I also coordinate hardware testing, which has been instrumental in driving the project forward, and I’m excited to see it through to a successful launch. My experience at Graco has allowed me to build strong leadership and technical skills that I’m eager to apply in my future projects.`,

        `At the University of Minnesota, my coursework includes data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems, discrete math, and software engineering. My math studies have focused on linear algebra, statistics, calculus, and physics. Recently, I worked on a team project to build a full-stack drone simulation of the UMN campus. This application combines a C++ backend with a frontend built in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It was a rewarding experience to work with a skilled team on a real-world project, and I’m proud of what we achieved. You can check it out on my DockerHub!`
