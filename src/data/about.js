        `Hello! My name is Dan, and I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for technology and learning. I am currently studying computer science and mathematics at the 
        University of Minnesota. I entered this field because I love programming and problem solving, and the way that I think lends itself very well to engineering. 
        I am also studying mathematics because I believe it teaches me to think critically, and is a foundation to any engineering discipline.`,

        `I am currently working as a software engineer at Graco, where I develop software for ProMix V, Gracoâ€™s upcoming flagship proportioning system. I have taken a leadership 
        role on the team, and review all code gets into our codebase, while also developing significant portions myself. We follow the agile 
        development process alongside a Delhi team, and therefore I participate in daily standups and regular sprints, retrospectives, and release cycles.
        We use Jira for project management, and Git through BitBucket for version control. Testing on real hardware has gotten me so excited about the 
        project, and I have a deep interest in seeing this through to its release. I have had such a great time learning to develop software professionally 
        and collaboratively, and can not wait to see where this career takes me.`,

        `At the University of Minnesota, I have taken courses in data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems, discrete mathematics, 
        and software engineering. Additionally, for my math minor, I have taken courses in linear algebra, statistics, calculus, and physics. My most recent CS course had me 
        complete a semester-long group project in which I developed a drone simulation that surrounds the UMN campus. It was a great experience to work with a knowledgeable team 
        on a full stack application that has real work applications. It uses a HTML/CSS/TS frontend and a C++ backend, and I am proud of the work that we did. Check it out on my DockerHub!`
